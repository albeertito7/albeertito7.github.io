Notes:

- Ruby: is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language similar to python. Most used for building web applications, but has many other applications like data analysis, prototyping, and proof of concepts.
- Ruby Rails: the most obvious implementation of Ruby. The development framework built with Ruby.
- RubyGems (gem): is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.
- Bundler: provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact "gems" and versions that are needed. Ensures the "gems" you need are present in development, staging, and production. Starting work on a project is as simple as "bundle install".
- Jekyll: is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the site's look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.


Get Started:

- Install Ruby
- Install Bundler
- Install Jekyll
- Install Git


To create a new Jekyll site, use:

$ jekyll new
# creates a Jekyll site in the current directory



Layout: different ways you want a website to look, and you can specify for every .markdown file a different layout.

Folder _layouts: custom folder jekyll knows where the custom pages are.



# Project structure

_includes/ -> contains html for elements you'd repeatedly use, usually called "partials"
_layouts/ -> templates for different types of pages
_posts/ -> contains .md and .html blog posts
_sass/ -> contains styling for website that turns css for our site
assets/ -> possibly other .css or .scss files
img/ -> contains images

_config.yml -> store our site configuration data (config and global variables)
